                                        <div>Almost all major companies have adopted chatbots as a fundamental part of their internal
                                            and external communication strategies. They are used as an alternative to human workers
                                            who provide solutions to first-level queries, because of their ability to mimic human
                                            interaction with customers through a chat interface. In simple terms, a chatbot can initiate a
                                            conversation with users in the same way a human would do: it asks questions, answers
                                            queries of customers based on already set rules and logic.</div>

                                        <div>The performance of an AI-based chatbot is dependent on the knowledge input it has at the
                                            point in time. If a conversation with any user brings a query that they are not programmed
                                            to solve, they will skip that conversation or transfer it to a human operator.</div>

                                        <div>Unlike rule-based chatbots that perform only on the basis of given commands, an AI-driven
                                            chatbot is designed in a way to function on its own with the help of Natural Language

                                            major advantages of AI-based chatbots and what makes them better than rule-based

                                        <div>Certain behavioural patterns cannot be identified by human agents. In such cases, AI
                                            chatbots can identify the behaviour patterns of end-users, which you may fail to do
                                            sometimes. These patterns and insights can be examined to improve decision-making in
                                            business.</div>

                                            this is what AI chatbots do for you. AI chatbots provide customized responses to users and
                                            guide them to the right sources with the help of natural language processing and text

                                        <div>Once you have decided to implement an AI chatbot, the next question is ‘how to choose the
                                            right one for your brand?’ There are certain factors you should consider before opting for an
                                            AI-driven chatbot. Here are some of them:</div>
                                    </div>
                                    <div className='font-normal text-2xl leading-9'>
                                        <div>Multifunctionality</div>

                                        <div>When you choose an AI-based chatbot, ensure that the chatbot enables website users to
                                            organize meetings, converse with customer support agents, sign-up for newsletters, and
                                            have a look at related articles. A chatbot that offers numerous purposes is the only ideal
                                            solution to meet all your needs today. If an AI chatbot is able to perform multiple functions,
                                            then there is no need for the customer service agents to interfere at all. Overall, it can
                                            provide you with an excellent customer experience.</div>

                                            you can implement AI chatbots on multiple platforms like your website, social media

                                        <div>It is important to ensure that setting up your chatbot for the first time is not a difficult task.
                                            Your AI chatbot must be capable of dealing with queries and complaints according to the
                                            increase in complexity and volume of issues. Also, it should allow you to do it without or
                                            with the least help from your AI chatbot platform provider when it comes to customization
                                            and training of the chatbot.</div>

                                            getting a perfect AI chatbot will be very less. Always choose your technology consulting

                                        <div>AI-driven chatbots have already become an integral part of the technology stack in the
                                            workplace. Moreover, organizations that have already adopted AI chatbots have many
                                            benefits over those that have not yet moved to machine learning, automation, and artificial
                                            intelligence. AI-based chatbots can contribute a lot to improvise the customer service
                                            experience and brand recognition by offering an interactive tool to the customers who are
                                            already tired of the long queue in the customer support section. Another point to be noted
                                            is that these chatbots are never intended to replace human workers from their positions,
                                            instead, they aim to reduce their workload.</div>
