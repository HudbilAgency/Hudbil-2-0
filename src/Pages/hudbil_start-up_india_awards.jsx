                                            Private Limited, one of the leading creative marketing agency. The duo prior to founding
                                            Hudbil were working at distinct entities in different job roles. Shujjath is one of the early
                                            pioneers in the digital marketing space had begun his career in the marketing

                                            profession. But what brought them together in the common platform were their extreme
                                            passion and the unique vision. Shujjath’s zeal towards helping businesses to navigate the
                                            complicated journey with developing digital marketing strategies to grow their brand and
                                            Satvik’s immense zest for creativity led them to start a company in the creative content
                                            space. Thus, they decided to combine their avidity along with the knowledge garnered and
                                            institutionalise a platform that confines around the concept of ‘One Umbrella-fits-all-needs’.
                                            Hence, Hudbil came into existence.

                                            entrepreneurs. But without a vision, there would be no passion. I and Satvik identified our
                                            passion at a very early time and decided to give shape to it. Therefore, deciding why not to

                                            along with anticipation our passion, we came up with Hudbil - A 360-degree Marketing
